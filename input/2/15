<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Larry Cuba </ENAMEX> is widely recognized as a pioneer in the use of computers in animation art. Producing his first computer animation in 1974, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Cuba </ENAMEX> was at the forefront of the computer-animation artists considered the "second generation" --- those who directly followed the visionaries of the sixties: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> John Whitney, Sr.</ENAMEX> ,  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Stan Vanderbeek </ENAMEX>  and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Lillian Schwartz </ENAMEX> .

While still a graduate student at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> The California Institute of the Arts </ENAMEX> , he was convinced of the artistic potential of computer graphics, but this was years before art schools began teaching the subject. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Cuba </ENAMEX> 's solution was to solicit access to the mainframe computers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> NASA </ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Jet Propulsion Lab </ENAMEX>and teach himself computer animation by producing his first film, First Fig.

In 1975, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> John Whitney, Sr.</ENAMEX> invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Cuba </ENAMEX> to be the programmer on one of his films. The result of this collaboration was Arabesque.

Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Cuba </ENAMEX> produced three more computer-animated films: 3/78 (Objects and Transformations), Two Space, and Calculated Movements. These works were shown at film festivals throughout the world---including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> Los Angeles </ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> Hiroshima </ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">  Zagreb </ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">  Bangkok </ENAMEX> ---and have won numerous awards. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Cuba </ENAMEX> 's been invited to present his work at various conferences such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Siggraph </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">  ISEA </ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Ars Electronica </ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Art and Math Moscow </ENAMEX> and his films have been included in screenings at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> New York's Museum of Modern Art </ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> The Hirshhorn Museum </ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art </ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> The Art Institute of Chicago </ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> The Amsterdam Filmmuseum </ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> Isetan Museum of Art, Tokyo. </ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Cuba </ENAMEX> received grants for his work from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> American Film Institute </ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> The National Endowment for the Arts </ENAMEX> and was awarded a residency at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Center for Art and Media Technology Karlsruhe (ZKM) </ENAMEX>. He has served on the juries for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Siggraph Electronic Theater </ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Montpellier Festival  of Abstract Film </ENAMEX> , The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Ann Arbor Film Festival </ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Ars Electronica </ENAMEX> .

In the pure form of abstraction that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Cuba </ENAMEX> pursues, visual perception is paramount. But because the images are generated via algorithms written in computer language, there is a paradox in trying to use words to describe images for which words do not exist.

As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Raphael Bassan </ENAMEX> wrote in a 1981 issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> La Revue du Cinema </ENAMEX> , "The computer animation establishes a parallel between visual perception and a structure of linguistic or mathematical order: it is concerned with establishing a new organizational field for the aesthetic material. …In the sphere of abstract cinema (lacking a better term), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Larry Cuba </ENAMEX> 's research is, in fact, at the origin of a new direction which does not yet have a name…"

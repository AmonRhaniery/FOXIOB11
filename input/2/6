<ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> G-number  </ENAMEX> 

A <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> (G)raphics researcher's G-number  </ENAMEX>  is calculated as the number of papers/books/citations on <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> (G)oogle Scholar  </ENAMEX>  that contain more than 200 cites. Note that the best way to search <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Google scholar  </ENAMEX>  seems to be by using the first initial of the first name, e.g. " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> r fedkiw  </ENAMEX>  ". (G)eez, there are so many citation indexes out there, I just felt like we needed another one. Note that G comes before H (as in h-humber), and that G also stands Graphics, Google, and even Goober. This is only a partial list that I put together when I was bored one day. No omissions or errors are intentional, but rather an indication of my competence. Please feel free to email me corrections, additions... or even a complete list. Since this has been posted, I have received emails about a few people who collaborate with graphics folks (applied math, computer vision and robotics researchers) and have added some suggested names to the list - just for fun... NOTE: I will periodically update the names on this list to the best of my ability, but finding new names to add to the list is more difficult - emails pertaining to this are greatly appreciated!

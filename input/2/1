Research Interests
My research interests are in applying programming language technology to improve the 
development, maintenance, and performance of software systems. I am particularly 
interested in mechanization of the metatheory of programming languages, type-oriented
compilation strategies, in type-based certification of machine code, and in the design 
of practical, high- or low-level programming languages.

Publications
Most of my publications are available online.

Current Events

    "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"

    "The most important one," answered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Jesus </ENAMEX> , "is this: 'Hear, O 
    <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> Israel </ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Lord </ENAMEX> our God, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Lord </ENAMEX> is one. Love the 
    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Lord </ENAMEX> your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with 
    all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: 
    'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."

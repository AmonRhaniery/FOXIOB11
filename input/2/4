Assistant Professor

Current Research
I am interested in the social aspects of computer networks and exchange systems. My current research topics include the role of information as the object of exchange in social exchange environments and the production of collective goods in computer-mediated exchange networks. My current collaborative work on focuses on the relationship between exchange structures and risk, uncertainty, trust, and cooperation (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION"> U.S. </ENAMEX> and across societies).

What is the best thing about working at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> iSchool </ENAMEX> ?
One of the most exciting and rewarding things about our program is its multi-disciplinary nature. I love the fact that faculty and students are continually exposed to new, cutting-edge research that spans the social, technical, theoretical, and practical dimensions of information and information technology.

Something few people know about me
I know little to nothing about sports. Despite my best efforts to hide this fact, my cover was once blown when I sincerely congratulated my graduate school advisor’s son for throwing several successful ‘interceptions’ during a high school football game.

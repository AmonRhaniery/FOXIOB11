interested in: software reliability, software analysis methods, formal verification, metrics, logic model checking, distributed systems design, analysis of multi-threaded software, testing, requirements capture and analysis, algorithms, user interface design, graphic design, text processing, image processing, history of technology, technology transfer.

before joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> jpl  </ENAMEX>  i worked in the cs research group at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> bell labs  </ENAMEX>  (1980-1981 and 1983-2003) a truly remarkable group that was given virtually complete freedom to pursue research goals, with no perceptible management oversight. i made a map of the 5th floor at stair 9 in building 2, the most desirable location for one's office at the time. the map lists the main occupants for each office over the years, with the person that occupied it the longest in red. from the 30-some people shown on this map, just a few remained to witness the final disappearance of center 1127 from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> bell labs  </ENAMEX>  org charts in august 2005: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> rae mclellan  </ENAMEX>  , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> howard trickey  </ENAMEX>  (since moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> google  </ENAMEX>  ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> dennis ritchie  </ENAMEX>  . one by one, the others all found a safe haven elsewhere.
remarkably, 8 of the 30 people whose name is shown on this map (and about 18 former members of center 1127 alltogether) now work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> google  </ENAMEX>  .

Software
	

    * <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Spin  </ENAMEX>  an efficient verification system for distributed software systems (a logic model checker).
    * <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Feaver   </ENAMEX>  a model extraction system for ANSI-C source code: the first step towards the development of a general purpose tool for the verification of distributed systems applications directly from program source text. the system was used at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"> Bell Labs  </ENAMEX>  between 1998 and 2000 to exhaustively verify the call-processing software of <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Lucent's PathStar  </ENAMEX>  access server. The source code is available, see the <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Modex  </ENAMEX>  distribution page.
    * <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Uno  </ENAMEX>  A simple static analysis tool for ANSI C programs, based on Ctree 0.14.
    * <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Ubet  </ENAMEX>  a requirements capture and analysis toolset from around 1995, originally called <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> msc/poga  </ENAMEX> , later productized and distributed within <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Lucent   </ENAMEX>  as the uBET tool.
    * <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Sdlvalid  </ENAMEX>  , an early verifier for SDL. the tool was written in 1987/1988, and was used internally for about five years. it was never approved for public release.
    * <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> microtrace  </ENAMEX>  a demo awk-script for FSM verification (written 1987).
    * <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Pico/Popi  </ENAMEX>  digital darkroom software (written 1984). For the curious, here is also a tar archive pico.tar with the pre-ansi c source code that includes the little on-the-fly compiler that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Ken Thompson  </ENAMEX>  and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Rob Pike  </ENAMEX>  wrote. The compiler in gen.c (also written in 1984) generated machine code for a VAX. Of course, this code will not compile or run on any modern machine. See also <ENAMEX TYPE="MISCELLANEOUS"> Pico's  </ENAMEX>  website.

A big welcome from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Gary Sims </ENAMEX>

This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"> Gary </ENAMEX> 's homepage and it is not exciting in anyway whatsoever and its brief!

All the real activity happens over on my blog: Simo's Sagacity (The quality of keen and farsighted penetration and judgment).

I have a web directory and also if you are intrested I have some bookmarks and a page of interesting links.

You can email me on gary at garysims dot co dot uk or at gmail.com (see bottom of page)

You can download my PGP Public key from here.

If I have helped you in some way and you want to show your appreciation then you can donate $5 to me here.
Brevity

My liege, and madam, to expostulate what majesty should be, what duty is, why day is day, night night, and time is time, were nothing but to waste night, day and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief.

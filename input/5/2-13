This is my home page, with examples of some of my hobbies. At the moment, I have some questions and answers about digital video cameras. I also have raytraced images and some utility programs related to computer graphics. Making music is another one of my interests, but I don't have the disk space (well... or the talent) to put it online. To look through my web page, you can look at the index or click on a link below.
